        HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.
